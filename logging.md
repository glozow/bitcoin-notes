# Logging

## How to configure bitcoind debug logging

### On node startup

Logging can be configured on bitcoind startup with the `-debug=` option.

For example, `bitcoind -debug=lock -debug=i2p` on the command line will turn on
logging of lock contentions and I2P information in the debug log.

The same options can be used in the `bitcoin.conf` file without the leading
hyphen and with one command per line:

    debug=lock
    debug=i2p

### On a running node

Logging can be read and set on a running instance of bitcoind using the
logging RPC:

    bitcoin-cli logging
    bitcoin-cli help logging

#### Examples

To turn on debug=net:

    bitcoin-cli logging '["net"]'

To turn off debug=net:

    bitcoin-cli logging '[]' '["net"]'

To turn on debug=all:

    bitcoin-cli logging '["all"]'

To turn off all debug logging:

    bitcoin-cli logging '[]' '["all"]'

To turn on all debug logging except net and leveldb:

    bitcoin-cli logging '["all"]' '["net", "leveldb"]'
